# Yappatron iOS

Native iPhone companion app for Yappatron dictation.

## What Ships Here

- `YappatronIOS` iOS app target
  - SwiftUI recorder UI
  - Deepgram Nova-3 realtime WebSocket transcription
  - API key storage in Keychain
  - Background audio mode declaration
  - Latest transcript handoff through a Yappatron-tagged pasteboard item
  - Copy and share actions
- `YappatronKeyboard` custom keyboard extension target
  - Reads the latest Yappatron-tagged pasteboard transcript
  - Inserts text into the active iOS text field with `textDocumentProxy.insertText`
  - Optional one-shot auto-insert when the keyboard opens

## Current Type-Anywhere Model

iOS does not allow macOS-style global keystroke injection. The supported path is:

1. Start recording in the Yappatron app.
2. Switch to the destination app while the audio session is active.
3. Use the Yappatron keyboard to insert the latest transcript into the current text field.

The app declares `UIBackgroundModes = audio`, which is the same family of workaround used by many iOS dictation companions. iOS can still suspend or terminate the app, so this should be tested on-device under real switching patterns.

## Requirements

- Full Xcode installed and selected
- iOS 17+ device or simulator
- Apple Account in Xcode for free Personal Team device builds
- Bundle IDs:
  - App: `com.yappatron.ios`
  - Keyboard: `com.yappatron.ios.keyboard`

## Build And Run

In Xcode:

1. Select the `YappatronIOS` project.
2. Set your Personal Team on both `YappatronIOS` and `YappatronKeyboard`.
3. Run `YappatronIOS` on an iPhone.
4. On iPhone, enable the keyboard in Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards, then turn on Allow Full Access for Yappatron Keyboard.

## TestFlight

After a successful device build:

External testing still requires Beta App Review.
