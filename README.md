# Yappatron

Open-source voice dictation for macOS. Use always-on listening or configurable push-to-talk.

## What is this?

Yappatron is a voice dictation app that:

- **🎙️ Streams in real-time** — Characters appear as you speak (sub-300ms latency with Deepgram)
- **☁️ Cloud STT** — Deepgram Nova-3 for best-in-class accuracy with punctuation & capitalization
- **🏠 Local STT** — Optional fully local mode via Parakeet (Neural Engine, nothing leaves your machine)
- **✨ Dual-pass refinement** — Optional enhanced accuracy for local mode
- **🎨 Beautiful visualizations** — Psychedelic orb animations respond to your voice
- **⚡ Hands-free operation** — Optional auto-send for AI assistants and command-line tools
- **🎙️ Dictation modes** — Always-on listening by default, with configurable push-to-talk for noisy spaces

## Why?

Current dictation apps often force:
- Clunky UX
- Rigid hotkey workflows
- Closed source "trust us" privacy

Yappatron keeps the simple always-on flow, and lets you switch to push-to-talk when the room gets messy.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/alosec/yappatron
cd yappatron

# Build & run (macOS only, requires Swift 5.9+)
./scripts/run-dev.sh
```

**First launch:**
1. Grant microphone permission when prompted
2. Grant accessibility permission in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility
3. Start talking—text appears in your focused application
