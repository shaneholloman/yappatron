## Current Focus

**TOP PRIORITY: Input focus locking**

Yappatron currently types into whatever app/field has focus at the moment a final lands. For multi-speaker / meeting-mode use, the user often wants the transcript to flow into a *specific* destination (e.g., a Claude Code chat) regardless of where the cursor moves during the conversation. Right now, alt-tabbing or clicking another window mid-conversation splits the transcript across destinations.

Goal: a "lock onto this input" mode where the user designates a target text field (or window), and Yappatron continues typing there even if focus moves elsewhere.

Open design questions (no decisions yet):
- How does the user designate the target? Click-to-pick, hotkey-while-focused, menu listing recent inputs?
- Do we re-acquire focus before typing each chunk (briefly steals focus, types, returns), or do we type using accessibility APIs that don't require focus?
- What happens if the locked target disappears (window closed, app quit)? Pause? Fall back to dictation? Notify the user?
- Should the lock survive across utterances only, or across an entire session?

Initial sketch: enumerate distinct text inputs we've typed into (by app + window + field role) and present them in a menu as "lock to this input" options. Simplest possible MVP — we don't need click-to-pick for the first cut.

## Current State

### Mac app (main: 690f0e5)

Speaker diarization shipped end-to-end with a hybrid architecture: Deepgram does word-level segmentation, local FluidAudio embeddings handle identity by matching against an enrolled-speaker registry. The override layer eliminates Deepgram's cross-speaker contamination on enrolled speakers; un-enrolled speakers fall through to Deepgram's IDs with the rename UI as backup.

Three modes available via menu:
1. Speaker Labels OFF — original dictation behavior
2. Speaker Labels ON, no enrolled speakers — Deepgram IDs surface as `[Speaker 0]`, rename via menu
3. Speaker Labels ON, enrolled speakers — embedding-based override active, `[Alex]`/`[Mom]`/etc. with high confidence

Three line-break styles between speaker turns: none (inline), newline (TextEdit/Notes), backslash+newline (Claude Code multi-line input).

Validated easy-mode (quiet 1:1) cleanly. Hard-mode (3+ speakers, ambient noise) recoverable but not perfect — fragmentation is fine since override matches against voiceprint not ID, occasional phantom-speaker noise from overlap remains.

### Branches

- `main` — current shipped state
- `feature/speaker-registry` — original pre-STT embedding gate (dead, kept for reference only)
- `feature/local-segmenter` — experimental local-only diarization. FluidAudio segmentation was coarser than Deepgram's in our tests; reverted main, branch preserved for later evaluation if Deepgram regresses or a cloud-free path is needed.

### iPhone app (unchanged this session)

Native iOS project at `packages/ios/YappatronIOS` still installed on test iPhone via free Personal Team signing. Local mode (Apple on-device Speech) is the default backend. Awaiting first-run user validation. Companion keyboard extension scaffolded with Yappatron-tagged pasteboard bridge.

## What's Done This Session

### Diarization (2026-05-08)

- ✅ **Deepgram `diarize=true`** — word-level speaker tags + start/end timestamps in WebSocket responses
- ✅ **Word-level run aggregation** — consecutive same-speaker words merged into runs with start/end timing
- ✅ **`SpeakerLabelMap`** — UserDefaults-backed `[Int: String]` rename map, seen-IDs tracker, enabled flag, line-break style
- ✅ **`LineBreakStyle`** — three styles (none / newline / Claude-Code), persisted, exposed via menu
- ✅ **Always-label every utterance** — within-utterance same-speaker dedup preserved, cross-utterance label restart applied
- ✅ **Enrollment registry** — `~/Library/Application Support/Yappatron/enrolled-speakers.json`, JSON-backed `EnrolledSpeaker` records
- ✅ **`SpeakerEmbedder`** — actor wrapping FluidAudio's `extractSpeakerEmbedding` with one-time model load
- ✅ **`EnrollmentRecorder` + `EnrollSpeakerWindow`** — 10s capture flow with floating progress window
- ✅ **`HybridDiarizer`** — per-run override pass; cosine distance against registry, threshold 0.45, min run 0.3s
- ✅ **`StreamAudioBuffer`** — long-lived rolling audio buffer anchored to Deepgram's t=0 for run-slicing
- ✅ **Race fix** — `handleFinalTranscription` awaits the in-flight override task before emitting, so typed text reflects override decisions
- ✅ **`HybridDiagLog`** — append-only diagnostic log of per-run distances and override decisions for debugging
- ✅ **Menu wiring** — Speaker Labels toggle, Line Breaks submenu, Name Speakers submenu, Enrolled Speakers submenu (Deepgram-backend gated)
- ✅ **FluidAudio bump** — 0.9.1 → 0.14.4 for Swift 6.3 compatibility, two API call sites updated

## Next Priority

### Input focus locking — P0

See "Current Focus" above. Open design questions to be resolved before implementation.

### Other Backlog

- [ ] Auto-clear speaker rename map on new transcription session (Mom's foot-gun risk: yesterday's Mom can become today's Callie if reused)
- [ ] Confirm local Parakeet backend still works under FluidAudio 0.14.4 (smoke test pending)
- [ ] Address backspacing UX (flagged as disliked, untouched this session)
- [ ] Retroactive rename rewriting of already-typed transcript (open question — worth it?)
- [ ] Ensemble diarization (Deepgram + local segmentation + local identity) for harder real-world conditions
- [ ] Test iPhone Local mode on device end-to-end
- [ ] Enable / test iOS type-anywhere keyboard flow
- [ ] Hot-swap backends without restart
- [ ] App notarization
