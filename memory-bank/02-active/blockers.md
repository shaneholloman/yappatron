## Active Blockers

### iPhone First-Run Transcription — P0
- **Problem:** The installed iPhone app currently depends on a Deepgram API key to transcribe, and the user does not want to create/fetch one just to test the mobile spike.
- **Decision direction:** Spike local/on-device ASR next, preferably reusing FluidAudio/Parakeet if viable on iOS.
- **Why it matters:** The app now launches on iPhone, so transcription itself is the next proof point.

### iOS Keyboard Enablement — P1
- **Problem:** The keyboard extension is installed with the app, but the user still needs to enable it in iOS settings and allow Full Access before type-anywhere insertion can be tested.
- **Path:** Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards > Add New Keyboard > Yappatron Keyboard, then enable Allow Full Access.
- **Tradeoff:** The free Personal Team build uses a Yappatron-tagged `UIPasteboard` bridge instead of App Groups. This is less clean than App Groups but avoids paid provisioning capabilities.

### Normal Xcode Run Destination — P2
- **Problem:** Full Xcode Run still wanted the iOS 26.4 platform/runtime component. The ASAP install succeeded by using a CLI build that excluded `Assets.xcassets`.
- **Path:** Finish Xcode's iOS platform/runtime install later if normal Xcode Run, simulator builds, and app icon asset compilation matter.
- **Current workaround:** Signed device build/install works from CLI with build overrides and free Personal Team signing.

## Resolved

### Race Condition Crash (yap-e049) — P0 ✓ RESOLVED 2026-01-09
- **Problem:** App crashes randomly during use due to thread-unsafe buffer access
- **Root cause:** FluidAudio's internal audio buffer accessed from multiple threads simultaneously
- **Location:** `StreamingEouAsrManager.process()` → `removeFirst(_:)`
- **Failed approach:** Serial DispatchQueue + semaphore blocked audio thread, causing glitches
- **Solution:** Actor-based buffer queue pattern
  - Created `AudioBufferQueue` actor for thread-safe buffer management
  - Audio callback enqueues buffers asynchronously (non-blocking)
  - Separate processing task dequeues and processes buffers serially
  - Proper buffer copying prevents data races
  - Max queue size (100) prevents unbounded memory growth
- **Implementation:** `TranscriptionEngine.swift:17-57`, `363-387`
- **Result:** Audio thread never blocks, serial processing guaranteed, no race conditions

## Resolved

### Permission / Input Not Working — P0 ✓ RESOLVED 2026-01-09
- **Problem:** Permissions didn't persist across rebuilds when running bare Swift executable
- **Root cause:** Running from `.build/debug/` meant binary hash changed on every rebuild, breaking permission tracking
- **Solution:** Created proper .app bundle with stable bundle ID + location
  - Enhanced Info.plist with complete metadata and permission descriptions
  - Built proper `Yappatron.app` bundle structure
  - Ad-hoc signed entire bundle (free, no Developer Program needed)
  - Installed to `/Applications/` for stable location
  - Bundle ID `com.yappatron.app` provides stable identity
- **Result:** Permissions now persist across rebuilds. Transcription confirmed working.
- **Scripts:** `./scripts/run-dev.sh` builds and installs automatically
- **Documentation:** See BUILD.md
